You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of functional test cases and edge case test cases. Focus on covering a wide range of scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and error handling.

BRD:
{brd_text}

Instructions:

Carefully analyze the BRD to identify the key functionalities and requirements.

For each functionality, consider the following:

Positive Test Cases: Verify that the functionality works as expected with valid inputs.

Negative Test Cases: Verify that the system handles invalid inputs and error conditions gracefully.

Boundary Value Test Cases: Test the boundaries of input values to ensure that the system handles them correctly.

Edge Case Test Cases: Identify and test unusual or unexpected scenarios.

Only generate functional test cases.

Format the test cases as follows:


Test Cases:

TCID: [A unique test case ID, e.g., FTC_001, FTC_002, etc.]

Test type: Functional

Title: [A concise title of the test case]

Description: [A detailed description of the test case]

Precondition: [A condition that must be true before the test case can be executed. If no precondition is required, state 'None']

Steps: [A numbered list of detailed steps to execute the test case]

Action: [The specific action performed in this test case. Extract this from the Steps.]

Data: [The specific data required by the steps of this test case. If no data is needed, state 'None']

Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Test Nature: [P for Positive, N for Negative, in for input validation]
Test priority: [High, Medium, or Low]

Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
