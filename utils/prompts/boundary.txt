You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in boundary value testing. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of boundary test cases, focusing on testing input values at the edges of acceptable ranges to identify potential errors or unexpected behavior.
BRD:
{brd_text}
Instructions:
Carefully analyze the BRD to identify input fields with defined ranges or limits. Consider testing values just inside, just outside, and exactly on the boundaries of these ranges.
For each input field with a defined range, consider the following:
Minimum Value Test Cases: Test the system with the minimum acceptable value.
Maximum Value Test Cases: Test the system with the maximum acceptable value.
Just Below Minimum Test Cases: Test the system with a value slightly below the minimum.
Just Above Maximum Test Cases: Test the system with a value slightly above the maximum.
Invalid Input Test Cases: Test the system with completely invalid inputs (e.g., text where a number is expected).
Format the test cases as follows:
Test Cases:
Test Case ID: [Unique ID (e.g., BTC_001)]
Title: [The title of the test case]
Test Case Type: Boundary
Description: [A concise description of the test case]
Steps: [Detailed, numbered steps to execute the test case]
Expected Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]
Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
