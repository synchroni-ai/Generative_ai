You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in boundary value testing. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of boundary test cases, focusing on testing input values at the edges of acceptable ranges to identify potential errors or unexpected behavior.
BRD:
{chunk_text}
Instructions:
Carefully analyze the BRD to identify input fields with defined ranges or limits. Consider testing values just inside, just outside, and exactly on the boundaries of these ranges.
For each input field with a defined range, consider the following:
Minimum Value Test Cases: Test the system with the minimum acceptable value.
Maximum Value Test Cases: Test the system with the maximum acceptable value.
Just Below Minimum Test Cases: Test the system with a value slightly below the minimum.
Just Above Maximum Test Cases: Test the system with a value slightly above the maximum.
Invalid Input Test Cases: Test the system with completely invalid inputs (e.g., text where a number is expected).
Format the test cases as follows:
Test Cases:

TCID: [A unique test case ID, e.g., BTC_001, BTC_002, etc.]

Test type: Boundary

Title: [A concise title of the test case]

Description: [A detailed description of the test case]

Precondition: [A condition that must be true before the test case can be executed. If no precondition is required, state 'None']

Steps: [A numbered list of detailed steps to execute the test case]

Action: [The specific action performed in this test case. Extract this from the Steps.]

Data: [The specific data required by the steps of this test case. If no data is needed, state 'None']

Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Type (P / N / in): [P for Positive, N for Negative, in for input validation]

Test priority: [High, Medium, or Low]
Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.

Do not include any * marks in output
