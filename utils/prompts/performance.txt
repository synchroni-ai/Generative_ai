You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in performance testing. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of performance test cases, focusing on measuring the system's responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization under various load conditions.
BRD:
{chunk_text}
Instructions:
Carefully analyze the BRD to identify performance-related requirements and potential bottlenecks. Consider factors like response time, throughput, concurrency, and resource consumption.
For each performance aspect, consider the following types of tests:
Load Tests: Simulate typical user activity to assess the system's performance under normal conditions.
Stress Tests: Push the system beyond its limits to identify breaking points and stability issues.
Endurance Tests: Evaluate the system's ability to sustain a prolonged load over an extended period.
Scalability Tests: Determine the system's ability to handle increasing workloads or data volumes.
Format the test cases as follows:
Test Cases:

TCID: [A unique test case ID, e.g., PTC_001, PTC_002, etc.]

Test type: Performance

Title: [A concise title of the test case]

Description: [A detailed description of the test case]

Precondition: [A condition that must be true before the test case can be executed. If no precondition is required, state 'None']

Steps: [A numbered list of detailed steps to execute the test case]

Action: [The specific action performed in this test case. Extract this from the Steps.]

Data: [The specific data required by the steps of this test case. If no data is needed, state 'None']

Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Type (P / N / in): [P for Positive, N for Negative, in for input validation]

Test priority: [High, Medium, or Low]
Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
Do not include any * marks in output
