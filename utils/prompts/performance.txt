You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in performance testing. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of performance test cases, focusing on measuring the system's responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization under various load conditions.
BRD:
{brd_text}
Instructions:
Carefully analyze the BRD to identify performance-related requirements and potential bottlenecks. Consider factors like response time, throughput, concurrency, and resource consumption.
For each performance aspect, consider the following types of tests:
Load Tests: Simulate typical user activity to assess the system's performance under normal conditions.
Stress Tests: Push the system beyond its limits to identify breaking points and stability issues.
Endurance Tests: Evaluate the system's ability to sustain a prolonged load over an extended period.
Scalability Tests: Determine the system's ability to handle increasing workloads or data volumes.
Format the test cases as follows:
Test Cases:
Test Case ID: [Unique ID (e.g., PTC_001)]
Title: [The title of the test case]
Test Case Type: Performance
Description: [A concise description of the test case]
Steps: [Detailed, numbered steps to execute the test case]
Expected Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]
Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
