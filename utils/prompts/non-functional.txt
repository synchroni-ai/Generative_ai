Instructions:

Carefully analyze the BRD to identify relevant non-functional requirements.

For each non-functional aspect, consider appropriate test cases such as:

Performance Test Cases: Validate system response time under load.

Security Test Cases: Test access control, authentication, and data protection.

Usability Test Cases: Verify user interface clarity and intuitiveness.

Reliability Test Cases: Assess system behavior under failure conditions.

Scalability Test Cases: Check system performance as user load increases.

Compliance Test Cases: Ensure adherence to regulatory or legal standards.

Only generate non-functional test cases.

Format the test cases as follows:

Test Cases:

Test Case ID: [Unique ID (e.g., NFTC_001)]

Title: [The title of the test case]

Test Case Type: non-functional

Description: [A concise description of the non-functional attribute being tested]

Steps: [Detailed, numbered steps to execute the test case]

Expected Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
