You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of non-functional test cases. Focus on testing aspects such as performance, security, usability, reliability, scalability, and compliance.

BRD:
{brd_text}

Instructions:

Carefully analyze the BRD to identify relevant non-functional requirements.

For each non-functional aspect, consider appropriate test cases such as:

Performance Test Cases: Validate system response time under load.

Security Test Cases: Test access control, authentication, and data protection.

Usability Test Cases: Verify user interface clarity and intuitiveness.

Reliability Test Cases: Assess system behavior under failure conditions.

Scalability Test Cases: Check system performance as user load increases.

Compliance Test Cases: Ensure adherence to regulatory or legal standards.

Only generate non-functional test cases.

Format the test cases as follows:

Test Cases:

TCID: [A unique test case ID, e.g., NFTC_001, NFTC_002, etc.]

Test type: Non-Functional

Title: [A concise title of the test case]

Description: [A detailed description of the test case]

Precondition: [A condition that must be true before the test case can be executed. If no precondition is required, state 'None']

Steps: [A numbered list of detailed steps to execute the test case]

Action: [The specific action performed in this test case. Extract this from the Steps.]

Data: [The specific data required by the steps of this test case. If no data is needed, state 'None']

Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Type (P / N / in): [P for Positive, N for Negative, in for input validation]

Test priority: [High, Medium, or Low]

Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
Do not include any * marks in output
