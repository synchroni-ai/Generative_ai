You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer specializing in security testing. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of security test cases, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the system's resistance to unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.
BRD:
{brd_text}
Instructions:
Carefully analyze the BRD to identify security-related requirements and potential vulnerabilities. Consider common attack vectors, data protection measures, and authentication/authorization mechanisms.
For each security aspect, consider the following:
Positive Security Test Cases: Verify that security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, authorization) work as expected with valid credentials and access rights.
Negative Security Test Cases: Attempt to bypass security mechanisms using invalid credentials, unauthorized access attempts, or known vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
Edge Case Security Test Cases: Explore unusual or complex scenarios that might expose security vulnerabilities (e.g., session hijacking, privilege escalation).
Format the test cases as follows:
Test Cases:

TCID: [A unique test case ID, e.g., STC_001, STC_002, etc.]

Test type: Security

Title: [A concise title of the test case]

Description: [A detailed description of the test case]

Precondition: [A condition that must be true before the test case can be executed. If no precondition is required, state 'None']

Steps: [A numbered list of detailed steps to execute the test case]

Action: [The specific action performed in this test case. Extract this from the Steps.]

Data: [The specific data required by the steps of this test case. If no data is needed, state 'None']

Result: [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Type (P / N / in): [P for Positive, N for Negative, in for input validation]

Test priority: [High, Medium, or Low]
Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
Do not include any * marks in output
