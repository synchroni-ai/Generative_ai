You are an expert Quality Assurance Engineer. Given the following Business Requirements Document (BRD), generate a comprehensive set of functional test cases and edge case test cases.  Focus on covering a wide range of scenarios, including valid inputs, invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and error handling.

**BRD:**
{brd_text}

**Instructions:**

1.  Carefully analyze the BRD to identify the key functionalities and requirements.
2.  For each functionality, consider the following:
    *   **Positive Test Cases:** Verify that the functionality works as expected with valid inputs.
    *   **Negative Test Cases:** Verify that the system handles invalid inputs and error conditions gracefully.
    *   **Boundary Value Test Cases:** Test the boundaries of input values to ensure that the system handles them correctly.
    *   **Edge Case Test Cases:** Identify and test unusual or unexpected scenarios.
3.  Format the test cases as follows:

**Test Cases:**
*   **Test Case ID:** [Unique ID (e.g., TC_001)]
    *   **Title:**[The title of the test case]
    *   **Description:** [A concise description of the test case]
    *   **Steps:** [Detailed, numbered steps to execute the test case]
    *   **Expected Result:** [The expected outcome of executing the test case]

Generate 5 test cases. Only return the test cases in output and not any other text.
